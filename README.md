# 🚀 AI Customer Reconciliation System (n8n)

AI-powered financial reconciliation system built using n8n for FMCG enterprises (OT / MT / D2C channels).

---

## 📌 Overview

This project solves the real-world problem of **customer reconciliation and claims resolution** in FMCG industries.

Manual reconciliation leads to:

* Delayed financial closure
* Working capital blockage
* Data mismatches (invoices, payments, claims, returns)

This system automates the entire process using **workflow automation + AI-based analysis**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Real-time visibility of customer ledger
* Automated mismatch detection
* Faster dispute resolution
* Reduced manual effort
* Improved working capital efficiency
